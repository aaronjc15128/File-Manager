## How it works
Before using the app, you will have to put all your files in one folder.

The program will then ask for the path for the folder.

Simple press "submit" and you'll be greeted with a mountain load of options to manage your files.

### Sorting
There are 4 sorting options:

File Extension
<br>File Type
<br>File Type & Extension
<br>File Name Prefix

Sorting by File Extension simply does what it says.
<br>Sorting by File Type sorts by the category of the extension (e.g. ".mp3" would be sorted into "Audio", ".png" would be sorted into "Images").
<br>Sorting by File Type & Extension sorts by File Type first, then, in them folders, it sorts by File Extension.
<br>Sorting by File Name Prefix sorts by a specified prefix in the file name.

### Renaming
There are 4 renaming options:

Adding Prefix
<br>Adding File Size
<br>Adding File Extension
<br>Adding File Type

Adding Prefix adds a prefix to the file name.
<br>Adding File Size adds the file size (rounded to 2dp) at the start of the file name.
<br>Adding File Extension adds the file extension at the start of the file name.
<br>Adding File Type adds the file type at the start of the file name.

### Deleting
There are 4 deleting options:

Prefix
<br>File Extension
<br>File Type
<br>ALL FILES

Deleting by Prefix deletes all files with a specified prefix.
<br>Deleting by File Extension deletes all files with a specified file extension.
<br>Deleting by File Type deletes all files with a specified file type.
<br>Deleting ALL FILES simply does what it says (you will be asked for confirmation :) ).
